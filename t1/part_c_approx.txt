### Approximate Density of States for Nonlinear 2D Harmonic Oscillator

Given the Hamiltonian:

H = (p_x^2 + p_y^2) / (2m) + (1/2) m * omega^2 * (x^2 + y^2) + lambda * (x^2 + y^2)^2

The density of states is defined as:

g(E) = d(Omega) / dE

### Step 1: Compute the Phase Space Volume
The kinetic energy constraint gives a momentum space volume:

Omega_mom = 2 * pi * m * (E - V(x, y))

The potential energy term in polar coordinates is:

V(r) = (1/2) m * omega^2 * r^2 + lambda * r^4

Approximating at large E where lambda dominates:

V(r) ≈ lambda * r^4

Solving for the maximum radius:

r_max ≈ (E / lambda)^(1/4)

Phase space volume integral:

Omega(E) ~ ∫_0^(E/lambda)^(1/4) (E - lambda * r^4) r dr

Since r ~ E^(1/4), we get:

Omega(E) ∝ E^(5/4)

### Step 2: Compute Density of States

g(E) = d/dE [ E^(5/4) ]

g(E) ∝ E^(1/4)

### Final Answer:

g(E) ∝ E^(1/4)
