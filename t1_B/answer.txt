Grand Partition Function Derivation:

We have a system of fermions with energy levels:

epsilon, 2epsilon, 3epsilon, ..., M * epsilon

Since fermions follow the Pauli exclusion principle, each energy level can have at most one particle.

The grand partition function is:

Z(beta, mu) = (1 + e^(-beta * (1 * epsilon - mu))) * (1 + e^(-beta * (2 * epsilon - mu))) * ... * (1 + e^(-beta * (M * epsilon - mu)))

Here:
- beta = 1 / (kB * T), which is inverse temperature
- mu is the chemical potential
- epsilon is the energy unit
- The product runs over all M energy levels, and each term accounts for the two possible states: empty or occupied.
