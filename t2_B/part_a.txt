Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) - Microstates

We have N indistinguishable bosons in a 2-level system with:
- Ground state energy = 0
- Excited state energy = epsilon

Since bosons do not follow the Pauli exclusion principle, multiple bosons can occupy the same energy level.

Each microstate is defined by how the N bosons are distributed between these two energy levels.

Define:
n0 = Number of bosons in the ground state (energy = 0)
ne = Number of bosons in the excited state (energy = epsilon)

Since the total number of bosons is fixed:
n0 + ne = N

Possible microstates:
1. All bosons in the ground state: (N, 0)
2. One boson in the excited state: (N-1, 1)
3. Two bosons in the excited state: (N-2, 2)
4. Continuing this pattern...
5. All bosons in the excited state: (0, N)

There are (N + 1) different microstates, since ne can range from 0 to N.

Key observations:
- Bosons can accumulate in the ground state, leading to Bose-Einstein Condensation.
- Unlike fermions, there is no restriction on how many bosons can occupy the same state.
- At low temperatures, most bosons occupy the ground state, forming a BEC.
