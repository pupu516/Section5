Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) - Microstates and Partition Function

We have N indistinguishable bosons in a 2-level system with:
- Ground state energy = 0
- Excited state energy = epsilon

### Microstates
Since bosons do not follow the Pauli exclusion principle, multiple bosons can occupy the same energy level.

Each microstate is defined by how the N bosons are distributed between these two energy levels.

Define:
n0 = Number of bosons in the ground state (energy = 0)
ne = Number of bosons in the excited state (energy = epsilon)

Since the total number of bosons is fixed:
n0 + ne = N

Possible microstates:
1. All bosons in the ground state: (N, 0)
2. One boson in the excited state: (N-1, 1)
3. Two bosons in the excited state: (N-2, 2)
4. Continuing this pattern...
5. All bosons in the excited state: (0, N)

There are (N + 1) different microstates, since ne can range from 0 to N.

### Canonical Partition Function
The partition function in the canonical ensemble is given by:

Z_C = sum over all microstates of e^(-beta * E)

Since the total energy of a microstate is given by:
E = ne * epsilon

The partition function sums over all possible values of ne:

Z_C = sum from ne=0 to N of [ C(N, ne) * e^(-beta * ne * epsilon) ]

where C(N, ne) = N! / (ne! * (N - ne)!) is the binomial coefficient, which counts the number of ways to place ne bosons in the excited state.

Using the binomial theorem, this simplifies to:

Z_C = (1 + e^(-beta * epsilon))^N

### Average Particle Number in Canonical Ensemble
The average number of bosons in the excited state is:

n_e_C = N * (e^(-beta * epsilon) / (1 + e^(-beta * epsilon)))

Since the total number of bosons is N, the number in the ground state is:

n_0_C = N - n_e_C = N * (1 / (1 + e^(-beta * epsilon)))

### Interpretation
- At low temperatures (high beta), most bosons occupy the ground state (n_0_C â‰ˆ N).
- As temperature increases, more bosons move to the excited state (n_e_C increases).
