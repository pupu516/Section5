i### Part (e): Average Particle Number in the Quantum Case

We have N indistinguishable bosons in a 2-level system with:
- Ground state energy = 0
- Excited state energy = epsilon

### Average Particle Number in Quantum Ensemble
The average number of bosons in the excited state under Bose-Einstein statistics is given by:

n_e = 1 / (e^(beta * epsilon) - 1)

Since the total number of bosons is N, the number in the ground state is:

n_0 = N - n_e

### Interpretation
- At very low temperatures (large beta), most bosons stay in the ground state, leading to Bose-Einstein condensation.
- As temperature increases, more bosons move to the excited state following the Bose-Einstein distribution.
