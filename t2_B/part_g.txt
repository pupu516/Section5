i### Part (g): Particle Number in the Grand Canonical Ensemble

We have N indistinguishable bosons in a 2-level system with:
- Ground state energy = 0
- Excited state energy = epsilon

### Average Particle Number in the Grand Canonical Ensemble
The average number of particles in the system under the grand ensemble is given by:

⟨n⟩ = kB * T * (∂ / ∂μ) ln(ΩG)

where ΩG is the grand partition function:

ΩG = (1 / (1 - e^(-beta * (0 - mu)))) * (1 / (1 - e^(-beta * (epsilon - mu))))

Taking the derivative with respect to μ, we obtain:

⟨n⟩ = (1 / (e^(beta * mu) - 1)) + (1 / (e^(beta * (epsilon - mu)) - 1))

### Interpretation
- This equation determines how the particle number varies with temperature and chemical potential.
- It is useful for studying phase transitions, such as Bose-Einstein condensation.
