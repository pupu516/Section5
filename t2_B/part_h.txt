### Part (h): Near-Degenerate Bose Systems

We have a system of indistinguishable bosons with:
- Near-degenerate energy levels close to each other.

### Simulating a Near-Degenerate Bose System
A near-degenerate system introduces small energy separations between levels, modifying the occupation of states.

For such a system, we can numerically compute:
- Negative chemical potential (μ)
- Ground state occupation ⟨n₀⟩
- Logarithm of ground state occupation log(⟨n₀⟩)
- Negative gradient of ground state occupation w.r.t. temperature ∂⟨n₀⟩/∂T
- Specific heat Cv

These quantities are computed by summing over all states:

⟨n⟩ = Σ 1 / (e^(beta * (epsilon_i - mu)) - 1)

### Interpretation
- The near-degenerate system mimics conditions where Bose-Einstein condensation occurs gradually.
- The occupation of the ground state changes smoothly as temperature decreases, leading to condensation effects.
