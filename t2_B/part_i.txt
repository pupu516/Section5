### Part (i): Bose System Without BEC

### Designing a Bose System That Does Not Experience BEC
A system that does not exhibit Bose-Einstein condensation must avoid the singular behaviors seen in thermodynamic properties.

### Conditions for No BEC
To prevent BEC, we require:
1. High level degeneracy: Many accessible excited states.
2. Large energy gaps: The energy difference between states prevents macroscopic occupation of a single state.
3. Strong interactions: Repulsive interactions between bosons suppress condensation.

### Observations
- The occupation of the ground state remains low even at very low temperatures.
- Thermodynamic properties such as specific heat do not show singularities.

By ensuring these conditions, we construct a system where BEC does not occur, meaning the bosons remain evenly distributed among available energy states.
