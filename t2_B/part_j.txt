### Designing a Bose System That Experiences BEC
To create a Bose system where BEC occurs, we need to observe singular behaviors in thermodynamic properties.

### Conditions for BEC
1. **Low temperature**: Bose-Einstein condensation occurs when the thermal de Broglie wavelength is comparable to the interparticle spacing.
2. **Low energy states**: The system must have a large number of bosons in the lowest energy state at low temperatures.
3. **Particle number conservation**: The total number of bosons remains fixed, leading to macroscopic occupation of the ground state.

### Identifying the Critical Temperature
The critical temperature \( T_c \) for BEC is given by:

T_c = (h^2 / (2πmk_B)) * (N / V)^(2/3)

where:
- \( h \) is Planck’s constant,
- \( m \) is the boson mass,
- \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant,
- \( N \) is the total number of bosons,
- \( V \) is the volume of the system.

### Observations
- At \( T < T_c \), a macroscopic fraction of bosons accumulates in the ground state.
- Thermodynamic properties such as specific heat \( C_v \) show discontinuities or scaling laws at \( T_c \).

### Numerical Simulation
To confirm BEC behavior, a Python program can be written to:
- Compute the occupation number as a function of temperature.
- Identify the scaling laws of heat capacity \( C_v \).
- Track the transition at \( T_c \).
